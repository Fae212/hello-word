Our program takes a user inputted name and age. Then it displays them with some printed out messages.
Here's how to do so:
  When you open the program and run it, you will see the message: "Input your name:" followed by a text box.
  This is done by the code:
  ```python
        name = str(input("Input your name:"))
  ```
  You then type in your name to the text box, and hit enter.
  Then you will see the message, "Your name is: (your name)" 
  This is done by the code:
  ``` python
      print("Your Name is: " + name);
  ```
  Then, you will see the message: "Input your age :" followed be another text box.
  This is done by the code:
  ``` python
      age = str(input('Input your age: '))
  ```
  You will then type in your age.
  Then you will see the message, "You are (age) years old".
  This is done by the code: 
  ``` python
      print('You are ' + age + ' years old')
  ```
Here is a gif illustrating how the code works:
